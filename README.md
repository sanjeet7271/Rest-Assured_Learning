## Components of an HTTP request
**ANS** 
1. An HTTP method (Get, Put, Post, Delete, Patch, and Head) that defines the action.
2. A URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) is the resource’s identifier on the server.
3. An HTTP Version, e.g. HTTP v1.1.
4. The Request Header carries metadata (as key-value pairs) for the HTTP Request message. Client (or browser) type, client-supported formats, message body formats, cache settings, and other information are examples of metadata.
5. The Request Body represents the data sent by the client to the API.
